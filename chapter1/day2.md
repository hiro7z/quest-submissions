### 1.What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
- Safety and Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

### 2.In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
I think the ease of development for developers is very helpful.
Compared to Solidity, there is less of a safety burden that developers have to be aware of, and the code is easier to read, which is great for reducing bugs.

It is also good for developers because the language is familiar to developers, easy to implement, and easy to debug.
